Helps to open and close the mysql in the Mac terminal automatically with just 1 app click

Just put this file in your Desktop and it should work

mysql-launcher.applescript shows what code I used for the launcher app

Click on mysql-launcher.app and u can forget about the commands:

brew services start mysql
brew services stop mysql


You just click the app, use mysql, exit mysql and you are done with the terminal :)
